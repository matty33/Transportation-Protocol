## The Third Generation of Transportaion

The Global Hackathon is in the initial phases of building the OceanBound Protocol Framework. A transportation protocol that aggregates the data of every transportation application and service to store on multiple blockchains.  Currently users are having to coordinate the use of multiple applications just to get from point A to point B.  Companies that are in the business of delivering goods are having to expend millions of dollars to research efficient transportation of their goods and build infrastructure.

We give you the infrastructure and development frameworks to build your transportaion applications.  Companies stake their own transportation and mobility data in exchange for integrations with other established companies in the space.  This collaboration of partners reward business and users with a seamless transportation experience and a central resource for connecting things.


TGH is looking to solve countless problems in this space through cross-chain transactions and data-sharing.  We are looking to have our community actively participate to help us build this protocol.  Finding ways to make each application on their respective chain feature rich or dive deep and enable the exchange of information across different blockchains.
