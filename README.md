# The Transportation Protocol

The Global Hackathon is in the beginning steps of building a The Transportation Protocol that is going to aggregate the data of every transportation application and service to store on multiple blockchains.  Currently users are having to coordinate the use of multiple application just to get from point A to point B.  Companies that are in the business of delivering goods are having to expend millions of dollars to research efficient transportation of their goods and build infrastructure.

TGH is looking to solve countless problems in this space through cross-chain transactions and data-sharing.  We are looking to have our community actively participate to help us build this protocol.  Finding ways to make each application on their respective chain feature rich or dive deep and enable the exchange of information across different blockchains.
